# This makefile is used to create shared libraries used in the Construct API.
# By default this makefile will produce the debug version of the shared library.
# To change this configuration use one of the following targets.

# debug	  -Same as default
# quiet	  -Compiles the library with the QUIET preprocessor flag
# release -Compiles the library with the NDEBUG preprocessor flag

# A complimentary set of targets is used to clean up their respective configurations
# clean_debug
# clean_quiet
# clean_release

# These targets/configurations automatically store intermidiary and output files in
# directories determined by the operating system and configuration.
# Output file targets use a wildcard match with the path for that file.
# This allows output files to be sent to other directories when created.

# The first section of the makefile can be modified by the user if necessary.
# The second section are contents that should not be modified as targets expect
# certain qualities of the variables they call.
# If a problem occurs, leave a comment on the GitHub repo, 
# contact the lead developer of Construct, 
# or post your issue to the ORA Google Group https://groups.google.com/g/ORA-google-group.

# What can you expect this makefile to do for you?
# This makefile automatically gathers up all source and header files from paths
# in the INC variable.
# To add additional directories, declare them in the ADD_INC variable,
# which appends the include directories list.
# In addition, the Makefile will add any preprocessor flags from the CXXFLAGS variable.
# These are added to configuration dependent preprocessor flags during compliation.
# The elements of this variable should be exactly as they appear in the source files.
# Libraries can be included via the EXE_OPTIONS and OBJECT_OPTIONS variables
# These are used verbatim in the compiler so be sure to use -l -L or -I to include paths/files 
# The Construct exes require a specific naming convention, which is also handled by this Makefile.

# The default configuration is Debug
# This variable controls the path files are stored in unless otherwise directed
# Ex. /path/to/makefile/Linux/Debug/
API_CONFIG ?=

# Allows for additional options to be given to the creation of object files.
# Options that are added to this variable in section are "-c -fPIC"
API_OBJECT_OPTIONS ?=

# Allows for additional options to be given to the linker process.
API_LINKER_OPTIONS ?=

# This variable adds preprocessor flags to the comiliation process.
# Elements do not need -D added infront of them and should appear 
# exactly as the flags are used in the source files.
# Additional flags are added based on the configuration in section 2.
CXXFLAGS ?=

# Root directory for files
SRC_DIR := .

# Defines any additional directories that should be included
# The base set of include directories are defined in Section 2.
ADD_INC ?=

#Add all includes here
#make sure there aren't any forward slashes before or after the dir
#location is relative to makefile
#the include dir needs to be in a subdir of the makefile
